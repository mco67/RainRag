# Getting started with the Rainbow Web SDK v2

## Welcome
**We are pleased to present our (new) Rainbow Web Software Development Kit (SDK) for the Rainbow platform.**  

It's a total rewriting from Rainbow SDK v1, taking advantage of new technologies and with a completely modernized toolchain.  

With this SDK you have the potential to build your own social network, your own banking, hospitality or whatever app you want with audio and video as well as multi-party chat interactions between your users just by importing this library to your app!

Take time to read this first tutorial to understand the basics and then deploy your imagination and your coding spirit to build your app!

## A new SDK for the Rainbow platform? 

But why? Wasn't the old SDK great?  

**Well, no! The old Rainbow SDK wasn't all that great!**

It had some serious drawbacks:
- **No ESM support**: SDK v1 is only distributed as a CommonJS library, when building an application with the SDK v1 your need to embeed the complete library.
- **No TypeScript support**: the SDK v1 was a pure Vanilla JS library, no type were provided.
- **Not framework agnostic**: the SDK v1 was based on the angularJS framework, and you have to embedded angularJS in your project event if you don't use it.
- **Poor API design and documentation**: the SDK v1 API are often difficult to use and to understand.

> ðŸ˜– **WARNING**  
> After v2's official release, we highly encourage you to use Rainbow SDK v2 rather than Rainbow SDK v1, as Rainbow SDK v1 will be deprecated.  
> If you've already developped an application with SDK v1, the migration strategy will be explain [here](/doc/page/guides/migration/migration).

## Now it's time to getting started

Getting started with Rainbow Web SDK could not be easier. By adding a single line to your existing JavaScript project, you will have access to the public API of the Rainbow Cloud Services.

This guide explains how to set up your Rainbow SDK v2 project. It includes information on prerequisites, installing, and optionally starting a sample example in your application to verify your setup.
