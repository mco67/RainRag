# Interacting with users

Rainbow is called a relationship machine because by using our SDKs and APIs you can find users, bots and things, keep a link with each of them, make groups and interact with them in a unique way.

Additionally, you can create privileged relations with them that let you access to information such as their availability.<br/> Doing so let you build a lot of scenarios and could help you knowing the best way to reach them.

The Rainbow SDK for Web offers a lot of methods that will be covered in that guide to let you build and manage your relationships.

## Rainbow Knowledge
Here are some Rainbow wordings that will help you understanding this guide.

## Preamble
As indicated in the introduction, using Rainbow, you can interact with users, bots or things.

Having an interaction means:

+ Being able to discover any entities such a users, bots or things

+ Being able to dialog actively with them for example by making a video call with an user or receiving an instant message from a bot

+ Being able to keep a link to them (e.g. retrieving the conversation or creating groups)

+ And being able to get passive information from them such as their connection presence, phone presence, etc... Which means having a privileged relation.

The different kinds of interactions are described in the following paragraphs.
